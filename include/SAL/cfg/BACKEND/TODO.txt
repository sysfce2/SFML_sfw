Split this into multiple modules, each with a separately configurable backend!
E.g. math, geometry, graphics, inputs/events, audio, time etc.

Note that one (compound) backend (like SFML) can provide services for more than
one of these interface modules (i.e. math, graphics, inputs, audio etc.).

An overall single BACKEND/.../DEFAULT.h header should then set multiple cfg.
macros, one for each interface module that a) the selected (compound) backend
has the functionality for, and b) has the necessary adapters (vaguely analogous
e.g. to NT's HAL drivers) implemented.
