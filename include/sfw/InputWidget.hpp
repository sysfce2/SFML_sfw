template <class W> class InputWidget : public Widget

//!! Unfortunately, since the widget arg. W actually derives from this class(!),
//!! not Widget, we can't just tack a type constraint here, as it won't compile:
//!!template <std::derived_from<Widget> W> class InputWidget : public Widget
//!! And, of course, the (self-referential) real thing can't even be expressed in C++:
//!!template <std::derived_from<InputWidget<W> W> class InputWidget : public Widget

/*****************************************************************************
  Base class of widgets that are intended to receive user input (data)
  
  (This is implemented as a CRTP class solely to overcome a C++ limitation to
  support templated functions that would otherwise be unable to deduce their
  "actual widget" template parameter (W).)

  Notes on the "input thing":

  - Input widgets (that can have user callbacks, support the update(...)
    API etc.) should derive from this class (rather than Widget directly).

  - Every input widget has a dedicated value of a corresponding type that
    the widget represents (models, stores, displays etc.).

    This value can be set via user input actions, or programmatically by the
    constructor, and a dedicated set(...) method (and its overloads, if any).
 
    The current value can be queried with the widget's get() method.
    (Unfortunately C++ doesn't support overloading on return types, so for
    outward type conversions, separate getXxx() methods may be defined.
    However, it's better to define the widget's data type explicitly, with
    conversions in both directions (converting ctors and "cast operators"),
    and then just use a single set/get method.)

  - Input widgets are typically configured to have callbacks to be invoked
    when the widget's value gets updated (with the possibility of still
    ignoring unimportant interim changes).
